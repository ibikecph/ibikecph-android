# I BIKE CPH
This repository contains the code for the I BIKE CPH and Cykelplanen apps. It was made by taking the `develop` branches of three previously separate projects.

This project has been maintained by Spoiled Milk until late 2014 when it was taken over by BIT BLUEPRINT.  

## Code structure
As stated, this project brings together three separate projects, `IBikeCPHLib` (the *library*), `IBikeCPH` and `Supercykelstier`. The latter was previously called `Cykelsuperstier` and indeed some references might still use the old name.

The library implements all of the functionality needed for the I BIKE CPH app, so actually the `IBikeCPH` project is just a shell that runs the main activity of the library and publishes it under the `dk.kk` namespace, which is what the city of Copenhagen uses.

Supercykelstier also relies on the library for most of its functionality, but also implements some additional things, among other things the "Kn√¶k ruten" functionality.

The Java code is published under the `com.spoiledmilk` namespace, and split into packages that reflect what part of the app they pertain to. Model class names are suffixed with  `Data`.

## Creating a `secret.properties` file

To be able to build and sign the apps using the development-keystore in the root of this directory,
either add a secret.properties or as environment variables.
